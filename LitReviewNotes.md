### Q1: Which ML/AI approaches for usage in discrete/combinatorial optimization have been suggested?

- **List of approaches seen in this paper:**  
  - e.g. Supervised learning (e.g. pointer networks)  
  - Graph neural networks  
  - Reinforcement learning  
  - Deep learning / Transformer-based  
  - Hybrid ML + heuristic/metaheuristic  
  - Large Language Model (LLM) hybrids  
  - Other (specify):  

- **Taxonomy / classification (if survey):**  
  - How does the paper group the approaches?  
  - What are the axes of classification (e.g., construction vs improvement, exact vs approximate, offline vs online)

### Q2: Which of these approaches appear promising?

- **Criteria for ‚Äúpromising‚Äù:**  
  - High solution quality (close to optimum)  
  - Good scalability (can handle large instance sizes)  
  - Good generalization (beyond training / synthetic instances)  
  - Efficient inference / compute time  
  - Adaptability to variant constraints (time windows, capacity, multiple vehicles etc.)  

- **Which approaches meet many of these criteria (according to this paper)?**  
  - List them, with brief evidence (e.g. ‚ÄúGNN + heuristic hybrid achieves small optimality gap on 10,000 nodes‚Äù; ‚ÄúTransformer model fast inference but weaker on constraint handling‚Äù)  

- **Which approaches have major drawbacks / limitations (in this paper)?**  
  - e.g. weak generalization, high memory, poor handling of constraints, high training cost etc.

### Q3: Which of the remaining ones (or the promising ones) are usable or adaptable for **our VRPTW** variant?

- **Does the approach already handle these constraint(s)?**  
  - Time windows (TW): yes / no  
  - Multiple vehicles / capacity constraints / depot constraints etc.: yes / no
